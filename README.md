A modern Manifest V3 rewrite of the classic Bandwidth Hero extension.  
Saves mobile data and speeds up browsing by compressing images through a proxy before they load.

---

## Features

- Image compression through your own proxy
- Data savings statistics (images compressed and data via proxy)
- Modern, mobile-friendly UI with sliders and toggles
- Grayscale mode for extra savings
- Exclusion list to skip specific sites
- Works on Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Kiwi, Ultimatum) and Firefox

---

## How it works

1. Extension rewrites `<img>` and `<picture>` tags on web pages.
2. Image requests are redirected through your proxy.
3. The proxy compresses and resizes images.
4. The extension tracks savings locally.

---

## Setting up a Proxy

This extension requires a proxy to work.  
You can host your own easily using:

Proxy repository: [bandwidth-hero-proxy2](https://github.com/himshim/bandwidth-hero-proxy2)

Deploy options: Heroku, Railway.app, Netlify Functions, Vercel, or your own Node.js server.

Once deployed, copy your proxy endpoint (e.g. `https://your-proxy.example.com/api/index`) and paste it into the Options page.

---

## Settings

- Enable compression: master toggle
- Quality slider (1â€“100): lower = more savings, higher = better quality
- Max width: resize down large images
- Grayscale: convert images to black and white
- Excluded sites: skip compression on selected domains (e.g. `google.com gstatic.com`)

---

## Stats

Options page shows:

- Images compressed
- Data via proxy (requires proxy to send `Timing-Allow-Origin: *`)
